# Self-Solving-Marble-Maze

Maze algorithm for self-solving marble maze project.

Eventually, a physical marble maze will be constructed from lego bricks and servos controlled by a raspberry pi will move the maze.<br>
The goal is to use vision processing to interpret the physical maze, apply this maze solving algorithm, and activate the servos to to follow the <br>
"path" returned by this algorithm
