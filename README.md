# Self-Solving-Marble-Maze

Maze algorithm for self-solving marble maze project.

Eventually, a physical marble maze will be constructed from lego bricks and servos controlled by a raspberry pi will move the maze.
The goal is to use vision processing to interpret the physical maze, apply this maze solving algorithm, and activate the servos to to follow the "path" returned by this algorithm
